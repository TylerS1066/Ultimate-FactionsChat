This plugin brings HeroChat style faction and ally chat to UltimateChat.

Due to the lack of support (see the [channel delay issue](https://github.com/FabioZumbi12/UltimateChat/issues/342)), it is highly recommended to not try to use UltimateChat.


## Version support
The `legacy` branch is coded for 1.12.2 and Factions 2.14.

The `main` branch is coded for 1.14.4+ and Factions 3.x.

## Download
Devevlopment builds can be found on the [GitHub Actions tab](https://github.com/TylerS1066/Ultimate-FactionsChat/actions) of this repository.
